AI Monitor: README

Overview

AI Monitor is a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation tool designed to streamline two primary functionalities:
	1.	BedrockLogger: Captures and stores logs for Bedrock-based AI models to enable efficient debugging, performance analysis, and monitoring.
	2.	LLM Evaluation: Provides tools and frameworks to assess the performance, accuracy, and effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs) with a structured evaluation process.


Features
BedrockLogger
- Real-time Logging: Captures API requests, responses, and metadata for Bedrock models.
- Error Tracking: Logs errors and exceptions to help identify bottlenecks and failures.
- Analytics Integration: Supports exporting logs to analytics platforms for advanced insights.
- Customizable Log Levels: Supports log levels such as DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, and ERROR for flexible logging.

LLM Evaluation
- Custom Evaluation Metrics: Supports defining custom metrics to evaluate LLMs.
- Performance Analysis: Measures response time, accuracy, and relevancy of LLMs.
- Benchmarking: Allows comparative evaluation of multiple LLMs to identify the best-fit model.
- Automated Reports: Generates detailed evaluation reports with visualizations for better understanding.
